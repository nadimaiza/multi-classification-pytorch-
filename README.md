## Introduction
This project demonstrates the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for multi-class classification tasks using PyTorch. The goal is to accurately classify data into multiple categories and handle binary classification scenarios as well.

## Features
- Binary and multi-class classification using CNNs.
- Data preprocessing and augmentation for improved model performance.
- Implementation using PyTorch for model development.
- Comprehensive evaluation of model performance.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **PyTorch**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**

## Installation
To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multi-class-classification.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd multi-class-classification
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

4. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. To preprocess the data and augment it, run:
    ```bash
    python src/data_preprocessing.py
    ```

2. To train the model, run:
    ```bash
    python src/train_model.py
    ```

3. To evaluate the model, run:
    ```bash
    python src/evaluate_model.py
    ```
